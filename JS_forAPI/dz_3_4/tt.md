Certainly! Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the handleLikeButtonClick function works with the getRandomImage function and the local storage:

1.  The handleLikeButtonClick function is defined and it starts by declaring a variable likedImageId and selecting the likesCountElement by its id.
2.  Inside the handleLikeButtonClick function, an event listener is added to the likeButtonElement for the click event. When the likeButtonElement is clicked, the anonymous function inside the addEventListener is executed.
3.  Inside the anonymous function, an attempt is made to increment the likesCount by 1 and store the new likesCount in the likesCountElement.
4.  After that, the getRandomImage function is called and its result is stored in the likedImageId variable.
5.  The likedImageId is then stored in the local storage with the key likedImageId.id.
6.  The getRandomImage function is commented out, and it is mentioned that it should be used to update the image and information on the page.
7.  The history array is commented out, and it is mentioned that it should be used to store the history of the images that the user has viewed.
8.  The localStorage.setItem("history", JSON.stringify(history)) line is commented out, and it is mentioned that it should be used to store the history array in the local storage.
9.  If any errors occur during the execution of the anonymous function, they are logged to the console using console.error("Error fetching image:", error);.

This is how the handleLikeButtonClick function works with the getRandomImage function and the local storage.

1.  When the page loads, it fetches a random image and displays it along with its likes count, photographer's name, and Like and Dislike buttons.
2.  When the user clicks on the Like button, the code increments the likes count by 1, sets the likedImageId in localStorage to the current image's id, and updates the image and info with the new likes count.
3.  When the user clicks on the Dislike button, the code decrements the likes count by 1, sets the dislikedImageId in localStorage to the current image's id, and updates the image and info with the new likes count.
4.  When the user clicks on the Next button, the code checks if there's a likedImageId in localStorage. If there's no likedImageId, it fetches a new random image and updates the image and info. If there's a likedImageId, it sets the likedImageId to the previous image's id, fetches a new random image, and updates the image and info with the new likes count.
5.  When the user clicks on the Previous button, the code checks if there's a likedImageId in localStorage. If there's a likedImageId, it sets the likedImageId to the previous image's id, fetches a new random image, and updates the image and info with the new likes count. If there's no likedImageId, it fetches a new random image and updates the image and info.
6.  When the user clicks on the Like or Dislike button, the code updates the history array in localStorage by pushing the current image's id to it.
7.  When the user clicks on the Register button, the code checks if the user's name is already registered. If the user's name is not registered, it adds the user's name to the users array in localStorage and alerts the user that they have been registered successfully. If the user's name is already registered, it alerts the user that they have already been registered.

async function handleNextButtonClick() {
const likedImageId = localStorage.getItem("likedImageId");
const history = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("history")) || [];
const index = history.indexOf(likedImageId);

// if (index === -1) {
// const imageData = await getRandomImage();
// updateImageAndInfo(imageData);
// history.push(imageData.id);
// localStorage.setItem("history", JSON.stringify(history));
// } else {
// const previousImageId = history[index - 1];
// const imageData = await getRandomImage();
// updateImageAndInfo(imageData);
// localStorage.setItem("likedImageId", previousImageId);
// history.splice(index, 1);
// localStorage.setItem("history", JSON.stringify(history));
// }
}

async function handlePreviousButtonClick() {
const likedImageId = localStorage.getItem("likedImageId");
const history = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("history")) || [];
const index = history.indexOf(likedImageId);

const previousImageId = history[index - 1];
const imageData = await getRandomImage();
updateImageAndInfo(imageData);
localStorage.setItem("likedImageId", previousImageId);
history.splice(index - 1, 1);
localStorage.setItem("history", JSON.stringify(history));
}
